        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a human being who enjoys painting minifigurines and i make meme compilations. I have an exam. 
            so why not make this website to post my revisions and make them accessible to the future generations.
            I am also learning how to code using this website. A bit like neal.fun.
